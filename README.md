# Newstar-ReactJs
This React app will run only if you download it in your machine and then launch it through the terminal as the API used in this app does not provide data when hosted
globally on a web server.

If you want to run this project then follow these steps:
1. Open the project in VS code or any text editor
2. Open the terminal
3. Run Command: npm run start

This app will sucessfully run on server: localhost:3000/ on your machine.

Thank You.
